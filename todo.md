# Issues & Tasks

* Add paragraph anchors: each paragraph, etc, should get a label, so that issues
  can link to it.
  
  Should they be persistent? Or just counts? They could be counts within a
  section, but then will change if the section number changes or a paragraph is
  inserted or deleted. That would be OK if a specific commit is referenced, but
  not if a branch is referenced.
