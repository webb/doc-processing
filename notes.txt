-*-indented-text-*-

When you're droppping an name anchor in text, don't wrap the anchor around the
contained text; just make the anchor a point (a content-free element),

e.g., don't do this:

  <p>This is <a name="blah1">very nested <a name="blah2">thing</a> which might have</a> problems</p>

Instead, do this:

  <p>This is <a name="blah1"/>very nested <a name="blah2"/>thing which might have problems</p>
